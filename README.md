# Terrorism_Vulnerability_Data_Visualization_for_Indian_States
TERRORISM VULNERABILITY DATA VISUALIZATION FOR INDIAN STATES

The training data is got from- https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/
This visualization can be used to identify the states that are most at risk of terrorist attacks and understand the patterns and trends in terrorist activity across the country and develop effective strategies to counter terrorism. The data visualization includes a map of the Indian territory which is colour coded with different colours to indicate the severity of the threat. To develop the model, we use data from the “The Global Terrorism Database” which includes various sources, including government reports, news articles, and academic research. Data mining techniques are employed to extract relevant data and identify the factors that significantly impact a state’s vulnerability to terrorism. The project's methodology involves several stages: data collection, cleaning, feature selection, and model development. The model is trained using the data from the "The Global Terrorism Database" by START.inc with the dedication of being used for national security. The model is built on four hidden layers of neural network with ADAM's Optimization, with the resultant prediction being plotted using the Folium Map Library. The data visualization obtained can be specifically used for analyzing previous and evading future terrorist attacks.
